**Topic**: GotCha: A detection method of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC)  
**Overview**:  
CSMU_Taiwan team came up with a new detection method for early UTUC diagnosis based on microRNA capturing and rolling circle amplification(RCA).  
> How GotCha works?  
> The circular probe of GotCha binds to the target microRNA, which serves as the primer of RCA. Therefore, the readout of product DNA can be back-calculated to the amount of target microRNA in the sample. The results will then correlate to the presence of UTUC in the subject.

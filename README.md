**Topic**: GOTCHA - A detection method of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC)
**Overview**:  
CSMU_Taiwan came up with a new detection method for early UTUC diagnosis based on microRNA capturing and rolling circle amplification(RCA). 
**How GotCha works?**  
The circular probe of GotCha binds to the target microRNA, which serves as the primer of RCA. Therefore, the readout of product DNA can be back-calculated to the amount of target microRNA in the sample. The results will then correlate to the presence of UTUC in the subject.
